    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt </li>
        <li>2 cups white sugar </li>
        <li>1 cup butter, at room temperature </li>
        <li>3 eggs </li>
        <li>1 cup sour cream </li>
        <li>1 large lemon, zested and juiced, divided </li>
        <li>½ cup powdered sugar </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a fluted tube pan (such as Bundt®).</li>
        <li>Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt into a bowl.</li>
        <li>Combine sugar and butter in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Add flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with sour cream, beating batter briefly after each addition. Stir in lemon zest and pour batter into the prepared pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 55 to 60 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Run a table knife around the edges to loosen. Invert carefully onto a serving plate or cooling rack. Let cool completely, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Stir 3 teaspoons lemon juice, powdered sugar, and butter in a small bowl until a thick glaze forms. Drizzle glaze over the cooled cake.</li>
