    <h4>Everyone loves chicken nuggets, but sometimes we don't want all the fat that comes with deep frying. This recipe will give you the crispy crunchiness you love about chicken nuggets without the oil. This is an easy recipe and can replace your pre-made (processed, yuck!) frozen chicken nuggets! For more heat, just add some cayenne pepper to the breadcrumbs. Any dipping sauce will do! </h4>
